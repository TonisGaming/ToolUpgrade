# This mod and any other The Long Dark mod made by me (TonisGaming) has been discontinued

# Tool Upgrade
Tool Upgrade is a continuation of TheDevv's mod of the same name, that adds multiple new blueprints for making item variants and other items. 

* Make tool variants using scrap and materials from across Great Bear
* Break down cans, bows and arrows to get back some raw materials
* Create flour from acorns (I'm not crazy when I say that Hinterland said they're gonna do this themselves right?) and cooking oil from burning raw fat (Only with [CandleLight](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/Candlelight/releases))
* and much more (not that much more currently)

If you have any ideas for what you might want to see in the future do leave your suggestion and I'll do all I can within my skills, and if there are any issues just let me know and I'll do my best at fixing it

## Installation
* Download the latest version in release and place the .modcomponent file in mods folder
* If you're using [CandleLight](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/Candlelight/), you can install CL_ToolUpgrade.modcomponent instead to receive an extra blueprint (Cooking Oil)

* Requires [Modder's Tool Box](https://github.com/Jods-Its/Modders-Gear-Toolbox/releases) and [ModComponent](https://github.com/dommrogers/ModComponent) with its dependencies

## Changelog

**V1.0:**

* Contains all of the original blueprints from the original mod
* Added crafting icons to all of the blueprints
* Added the Improvised Handle to improve Woodwright's Bow blueprint
* Overall some slight changes here and there to all of the blueprints

**V1.1**

* Added the entire miners set (Jacket, pants, boots, helmet)
* Added a blueprint for the Insulated Flask
* Added an alternate Travois blueprint (In a perfect world, this would be a new, Tarp Travois)
